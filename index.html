                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p> I go bowling every Tuesday and Saturday. Saturday is where I compete in a team against other teams in a league. I am also the captain of that team. We have placed first once and second a few times.</p>

                    <h3>300 Games</h3>
                    <p>A 300 game is when a bowler gets 12 strikes in a row in one game. It's also called a perfect game because the max strikes in one game is 12. Last year on May 20th, I actually bowled a 300 game during a league game. It is the second youth bowler 300 at the bowling alley since its open.</p>

                    <h3>Bowling Club</h3>
                    <p> I am the captain of the Bowling Club. Not everything is set up yet this year but usually we would go to Empire Bowl after school every Tuesday and bowl 2-3 games until 5 pm. Each player does have to pay for the games; however the bowling alley gives a discount where its $5 for shoes and 3 games. If you have nothing to do on a Tuesday, come bowl some games!</p>
